Respira enables you to use AI tools such as Cursor, Claude Code, and other MCP‑compatible assistants to safely edit and manage your WordPress site.  
This guide walks you through installing the Respira for WordPress plugin, generating an API key, setting up the MCP server on your machine, and connecting your preferred AI assistant.  
If you are new to Respira, see the [Introduction](/introduction) for a product overview.

- Permission to install plugins on your WordPress site  
- Node.js installed on your local machine if you plan to run the MCP server  
- A Respira license or active trial  
- (Optional) A staging site if you prefer to test before going live

## Step 3: Install the WordPress MCP server

The MCP server runs locally on your machine and connects your AI assistant to WordPress.  
It is required for using Respira with Cursor, Claude Code, and other MCP‑compatible IDEs or tools.

### Option A: From npm (recommended)

```bash
npm install -g @respira/wordpress-mcp-server
```

  height="200"
/>

Or run without installing globally:

```bash
npx -y @respira/wordpress-mcp-server
```

### Option B: Download ZIP file

1. Go to your [Downloads page](/dashboard/downloads) (requires login)
2. Download `respira-wordpress-mcp-server-latest.zip`
3. Extract it to a location on your machine such as `~/.respira/mcp-server/`
4. Configure your MCP client to point to the `dist/index.js` file

## Step 4: Connect your AI assistant to WordPress

See the [Configuration Guide](/configuration) for setup instructions for:

- [Cursor](/configuration#configure-cursor-ide)
- [Claude Code](/configuration#configure-claude-desktop-claude-code)
- [Codex](/configuration#configure-other-mcp-compatible-editors)

Once connected, refer to the [Usage Guide](/usage) to learn how to prompt your assistant effectively.

## You are all set

Once configured, you can start using AI to edit your WordPress site. Try prompting your assistant with:

- List all pages on my WordPress site
- Create a duplicate of the About page
- Update the homepage title to Welcome

## FAQ

### Do I have to use npm to install the MCP server?

No. You can either install via npm or download the ZIP version from your [Downloads page](/dashboard/downloads). Both options run the same MCP server.

### Do I need Node.js installed to use the MCP server?

Yes. The MCP server runs locally and requires Node.js. If you do not have it yet, install Node.js first and then continue with Step 3.

### Can I install Respira on a staging site first?

Yes. Many users install the plugin on a staging or development site before enabling it on production.

### What should I do if something fails during installation?

See the [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting) guide for common issues and solutions.
