# Audit Logging

Audit logs help you understand what actions were performed through Respira and when.

## What gets logged

Typical log entries include:

- Timestamp
- Tool/action performed (e.g., update page, delete duplicate)
- Success/failure
- Site identifier (in multi-site setups)

Depending on your plan and plugin version, logs may also include:

- API key identifier/prefix used
- Request metadata (e.g., IP address)

## Why it matters

- Debug unexpected changes
- Support compliance and team accountability
- Trace safe-edit approvals and rejections

## Best Practices

- Keep a staging site for risky actions
- Review approvals in WordPress Admin before publishing
- Revoke unused keys
