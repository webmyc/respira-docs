# Data Privacy

Respira connects your AI assistant to your WordPress site via a local MCP server. Understanding what data is transmitted helps you operate safely.

## What data is sent

Depending on the tool you use, requests may include:

- Page/post IDs
- Content you want to write (HTML, builder data)
- Metadata fields (where applicable)

## What data is returned

Responses may include:

- Page/post content and metadata
- Builder structure (for builder extraction tools)
- Analysis results (SEO/performance/AEO)

## Minimize exposure

- Prefer read-only tools when exploring
- Only send the minimum content needed for the update
- Use staging for experimentation
