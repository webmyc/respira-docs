# How Respira Security Works

Respira is designed with security as a core principle.

## Authentication Flow

1. You generate an API key in WordPress Admin
2. MCP server sends the key with each request
3. WordPress validates the key before processing
4. Actions run through WordPress permissions and capabilities

## API Key Security

- Keys start with `respira_`
- Cryptographically random
- Stored securely (not meant to be shared)
- Revokable at any time from WordPress Admin

## Request Validation

Every request is validated for:

- Valid API key
- User permissions for the action
- Content security (basic XSS / injection safety checks)

## Safe Editing Workflow

By default, Respira never modifies live content directly:

1. Edit request received
2. Duplicate created as draft
3. Changes applied to duplicate
4. Admin reviews in Approve Edits
5. Approve → duplicate replaces original
6. Reject → duplicate deleted

## Content Security

Use [wordpress_validate_security](/tools/other/validate-security) to validate content before saving.

## Audit Logging

Many actions are logged (depending on your plan / plugin version). Logs typically include:

- API key used (or key ID/prefix)
- Action performed
- Timestamp
- Success/failure
