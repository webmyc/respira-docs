# API Key Management

API keys authenticate your AI assistant (via the MCP server) to your WordPress site.

## Generate an API Key

1. Go to **WordPress Admin → Respira → API Keys**
2. Click **Generate API Key**
3. Copy the key and store it securely (you won’t see it again)

## Store Keys Safely

- Treat the key like a password
- Do not paste it into public tickets or screenshots
- Prefer environment variables or local config files

## Rotate Keys

If you suspect a leak or want to rotate regularly:

1. Generate a new key
2. Update your MCP config
3. Revoke the old key

## Revoke Keys

Revoke any key you no longer need in **Respira → API Keys**.
