# Thrive Architect Reference

Technical documentation for using Respira with [Thrive Architect](https://thrivethemes.com/architect/).

## About Thrive Architect

[Thrive Architect](https://thrivethemes.com/architect/) is a conversion-focused WordPress page builder from Thrive Themes. It's designed for creating high-converting landing pages, sales pages, and opt-in forms with over 40 elements optimized for lead generation.

## Data Structure

Thrive Architect stores layouts in a custom format with elements organized in a nested structure. Content is stored in post meta:

```json
{
  "elements": [
    {
      "type": "section",
      "id": "sec-123",
      "children": [
        {
          "type": "contentbox",
          "id": "cb-456",
          "children": [
            {
              "type": "text",
              "id": "txt-789",
              "content": "<h1>Welcome to Our Site</h1>",
              "class": "hero-heading"
            },
            {
              "type": "button",
              "id": "btn-012",
              "text": "Get Started",
              "link": "/contact",
              "class": "hero-cta"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Module Identification

### By Custom Class (Recommended)

Add a custom class in Element Settings → Advanced:

```json
{ "admin_label": "hero-cta" }
```

### By Element ID

Each element has a unique ID:

```json
{ "admin_label": "btn-012" }
```

### By Path

```json
{ "path": "elements[0].children[0].children[1]" }
```

### By Type and Content

```json
{ "type": "button", "match_content": "Get Started" }
```

## Common Elements

## Smart Landing Pages

Thrive's Smart Landing Pages work with Respira for content updates while preserving the overall design system.

## Limitations

- **Conversion elements**: Complex elements like A/B tests and smart links need the builder
- **Thrive Leads**: Advanced lead generation settings need the Thrive Leads interface
- **Animations**: Entry effects and hover animations are preserved but need the builder
- **Global elements**: Thrive Architect global elements can be edited but changes need verification

## When to Use This Tool

- **Content optimization** - Update headlines, CTAs, and copy for conversion testing
- **Landing page maintenance** - Quick edits to sales and opt-in pages
- **Bulk CTA updates** - Change button text or links across multiple pages
- **Post-launch tweaks** - Adjust content based on conversion data
