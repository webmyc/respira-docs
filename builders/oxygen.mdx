# Oxygen Builder Reference

Technical documentation for using Respira with [Oxygen Builder](https://oxygenbuilder.com/).

## About Oxygen

[Oxygen Builder](https://oxygenbuilder.com/) is a professional-grade WordPress site builder that generates clean, bloat-free code. It completely replaces your theme and offers full site building capabilities with over 60 components.

## Data Structure

Oxygen stores page layouts as serialized component trees in post meta. Each component has a unique ID and nested children:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "ct_section",
  "options": {
    "ct_id": 1,
    "selector": "section-1-123"
  },
  "children": [
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "ct_headline",
      "options": {
        "ct_content": "Welcome to Our Site",
        "selector": "headline-2-123"
      }
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "name": "ct_link_button",
      "options": {
        "ct_content": "Get Started",
        "url": "/contact"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Module Identification

### By Selector (Recommended)

Each Oxygen element has a unique selector. Target it with:

```json
{ "admin_label": "headline-2-123" }
```

### By Custom Class

Add a custom class in Oxygen's Advanced tab:

```json
{ "admin_label": "hero-cta-button" }
```

### By Path

```json
{ "path": "components[0].children[1]" }
```

### By Type and Content

```json
{ "type": "ct_link_button", "match_content": "Get Started" }
```

## Common Components

| Component | Type | Key Options |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Headline | `ct_headline` | ct_content, tag |
| Text Block | `ct_text_block` | ct_content |
| Button | `ct_link_button` | ct_content, url |
| Image | `ct_image` | src, alt |
| Icon | `ct_icon` | icon_id |
| Section | `ct_section` | layout settings |
| Columns | `ct_columns` | column configuration |
| Div | `ct_div_block` | generic container |
| Link | `ct_link` | url, target |
| Code Block | `ct_code_block` | code_php, code_css, code_js |

## Example Prompts for Oxygen

**Content Updates:**

- "Update the Oxygen component labeled 'Footer Email' to support@example.com"
- "Change the headline selector 'headline-2-123' to 'New Headline'"
- "Replace the CTA button link with /pricing"

**Structure Queries:**

- "Extract Oxygen structure for the homepage"
- "List all buttons on page 42"
- "Show me the component tree for this page"

**Bulk Updates:**

- "Find all ct_link_button components with 'Learn More' and change to 'Get Started'"
- "Update the copyright year in all text blocks"
- "Change all H3 headlines to H2"

## Templates & Reusable Parts

Oxygen templates and reusable parts are editable:

- "List all Oxygen templates" → Shows template library
- "Update the header template phone number" → Changes it site-wide

## Inner Content & Gutenberg

Oxygen can include Gutenberg blocks via Inner Content. Respira can edit both the Oxygen structure and embedded Gutenberg content.

## Limitations

- **Conditions**: Oxygen conditions (visibility rules) are preserved but need the builder
- **Dynamic data**: Dynamic data connections are preserved but not directly editable
- **Global styles**: Oxygen's global colors and stylesheets need the builder interface
- **Custom PHP**: Code blocks with PHP are preserved but not editable through Respira

## When to Use This Tool

- **Quick content updates** - Change headlines, button text, or links
- **Batch editing** - Update the same content across multiple templates
- **SEO workflows** - Fix heading structure or missing content
- **Client maintenance** - Make content changes without needing Oxygen knowledge
