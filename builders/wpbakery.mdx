# WPBakery Builder Reference

WPBakery stores content largely as shortcodes. Respira can extract structure and perform targeted updates while preserving the rest of the layout.

## Example Prompts

- "Extract WPBakery structure for page 42"
- "Update the module that contains 'Get Started' to 'Start Free Trial'"
