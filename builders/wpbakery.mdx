# WPBakery Builder Reference

Technical documentation for using Respira with [WPBakery Page Builder](https://wpbakery.com/).

## About WPBakery

[WPBakery Page Builder](https://wpbakery.com/) (formerly Visual Composer) is one of the most widely used WordPress page builders with over 4 million active installations. It uses a shortcode-based architecture to store content.

## Data Structure

WPBakery stores layouts as nested shortcodes in `post_content`:

```text
[vc_row][vc_column]
  [vc_column_text el_id="hero-text"]
    <h1>Welcome to Our Site</h1>
    <p>We help businesses grow.</p>
  [/vc_column_text]
  [vc_btn title="Get Started" link="url:/contact" el_id="hero-cta"]
[/vc_column][/vc_row]

[vc_row][vc_column width="1/2"]
  [vc_single_image image="123" img_size="full"]
[/vc_column][vc_column width="1/2"]
  [vc_column_text]
    <h2>Our Services</h2>
  [/vc_column_text]
[/vc_column][/vc_row]
```

Each shortcode has attributes that control appearance and behavior. Elements can have `el_id` or `el_class` attributes for targeting.

## Module Identification

### By Element ID (Recommended)

Set in WPBakery: Element Settings → Design Options → Element ID:

```json
{ "admin_label": "hero-cta" }
```

### By Custom Class

Set a custom CSS class and target it:

```json
{ "admin_label": "main-cta-button" }
```

### By Path

```json
{ "path": "rows[0].columns[0].elements[1]" }
```

### By Type and Content

```json
{ "type": "vc_btn", "match_content": "Get Started" }
```

## Common Elements

| Element | Shortcode | Key Attributes |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| Text Block | `vc_column_text` | content (HTML) |
| Button | `vc_btn` | title, link, color |
| Single Image | `vc_single_image` | image, img_size |
| Row | `vc_row` | layout settings |
| Column | `vc_column` | width, offset |
| Separator | `vc_separator` | color, style |
| Message Box | `vc_message` | message_box_color, content |
| Video Player | `vc_video` | link |
| Icon | `vc_icon` | icon, color |
| Tabs | `vc_tta_tabs` | nested tab sections |

## Example Prompts for WPBakery

**Content Updates:**

- "Update the text block with ID 'hero-text' to say 'Welcome Home'"
- "Change the button with 'Get Started' to link to /pricing"
- "Replace the image in the first row with image ID 456"

**Structure Queries:**

- "Extract WPBakery structure for page 42"
- "List all buttons on the homepage"
- "Show me all rows and their column layouts"

**Bulk Updates:**

- "Find all buttons with 'Learn More' and change to 'Get Started'"
- "Update the phone number in all text blocks to 555-123-4567"
- "Change all vc_btn colors from blue to green"

## Templates and Presets

WPBakery templates saved in the Template Library are editable:

- "List all WPBakery templates" → Shows template library
- "Update the 'Contact Section' template phone number"

## Backend vs Frontend Editor

Respira works with content regardless of which editor was used. Both Backend Editor and Frontend Editor changes are supported.

## Limitations

- **Design Options**: Padding, margins, and responsive settings may need the visual editor
- **Custom CSS**: Per-element custom CSS is preserved but complex styling changes may require the builder
- **Third-party add-ons**: Support varies; core WPBakery elements have full support
- **Row/column structure**: Layout-level changes (column widths, row settings) are best done in the builder

## When to Use This Tool

- **Content updates** - Change text, links, and images without opening the builder
- **Batch editing** - Update repeated content across multiple pages
- **SEO fixes** - Fix heading structure or add missing content
- **Post-launch maintenance** - Make quick edits after site handoff
