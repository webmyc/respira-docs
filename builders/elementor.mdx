# Elementor Builder Reference

Elementor stores page layouts as structured JSON (post meta) and renders content through widgets, sections/containers, and nested elements.

## How Respira Works With Elementor

1. Detect Elementor on a page (or site-wide)
2. Extract a structured representation of the page
3. Update a specific widget/module using labels, paths, or types
4. Preserve all other widgets and settings

## Recommended Targeting: Labels

Use Elementor's Navigator to name important widgets/sections (or use an admin label pattern your team follows). Then target them with:

```json
{ "admin_label": "Hero CTA Button" }
```

## Common Widgets

| Widget | Typical Use |
|--------|-------------|
| Heading | Headlines and section titles |
| Text Editor | Body content |
| Button | Calls to action |
| Image | Images with alt text |
| Icon List | Feature lists |
| Form | Lead capture / contact forms |

## Example Prompts

- "Update the widget labeled 'Hero Heading' to say 'Start Here'"
- "Change the CTA button link to /pricing"
- "Extract the Elementor structure for page 42"
