# Bricks Builder Reference

Bricks Builder stores page structure as a JSON-like element tree. Elements are nestable and can represent sections, containers, headings, buttons, etc.

## Best Practice: Label Important Elements

Name key elements (hero, CTA, footer blocks) so they can be reliably targeted.

## Example Prompts

- "Update the Bricks element labeled 'Hero CTA' to link to /contact"
- "Extract Bricks structure for page 42"
