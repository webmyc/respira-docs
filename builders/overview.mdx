# Page Builder Support

Respira understands 10 WordPress page builders at the module level. This means AI can update specific sections, buttons, or text blocks without affecting the rest of your page.

## Supported Builders

| Builder | Modules | Data Format | Module Editing |
|---------|---------|-------------|----------------|
| [Divi](/builders/divi) | 200+ | Shortcodes | ✓ Full |
| [Elementor](/builders/elementor) | 100+ | JSON | ✓ Full |
| [Bricks](/builders/bricks) | 80+ | JSON | ✓ Full |
| [Oxygen](/builders/oxygen) | 60+ | JSON | ✓ Full |
| [Gutenberg](/builders/gutenberg) | Core blocks | HTML comments | ✓ Full |
| [WPBakery](/builders/wpbakery) | 50+ | Shortcodes | ✓ Full |
| [Beaver Builder](/builders/beaver-builder) | 30+ | Serialized | ✓ Full |
| [Brizy](/builders/brizy) | 40+ | JSON | ✓ Full |
| [Visual Composer](/builders/visual-composer) | 50+ | JSON | ✓ Full |
| [Thrive Architect](/builders/thrive-architect) | 40+ | Custom | ✓ Full |

## How It Works

1. **Extract**: Respira reads your page and parses the builder's data format
2. **Identify**: AI finds the specific module you want to change
3. **Update**: Changes are applied to just that module
4. **Preserve**: All other content, styling, and settings remain intact

## Key Tools

- [wordpress_get_builder_info](/tools/context/get-builder-info) - Detect active builder
- [wordpress_extract_builder_content](/tools/builders/extract-content) - View page structure
- [wordpress_update_module](/tools/builders/update-module) - Update specific modules
- [wordpress_inject_builder_content](/tools/builders/inject-content) - Replace structure

## Example Workflow

```text
You: "What page builder is my site using?"
AI: Uses wordpress_get_builder_info → "Your site uses Divi Builder"

You: "Show me the structure of the homepage"
AI: Uses wordpress_extract_builder_content → Shows sections, rows, modules

You: "Update the hero button text to 'Get Started'"
AI: Uses wordpress_update_module → Updates just that button
```

## Best Practice: Use Admin Labels

Set descriptive admin labels on important modules. This makes them easy to target:

- "Hero CTA Button"
- "Footer Contact Form"
- "Pricing Table Section"

Then: "Update the module labeled 'Hero CTA Button' to say 'Contact Us'"

## FAQ

### Which page builder has the best Respira support?

All 10 supported builders have full module-level editing support. Divi and Elementor have the most comprehensive documentation due to their widespread use, but Respira works equally well with Bricks, Oxygen, Gutenberg, WPBakery, Beaver Builder, Brizy, Visual Composer, and Thrive Architect.

### Can Respira edit Global Modules in Divi?

Yes. Respira detects Divi Global Modules and can update them. Changes to global modules propagate everywhere they're used on your site. Use "List all global modules" to see your global module library, then target specific ones by name.

### Does Respira work with custom builder modules?

Core modules from all 10 builders are fully supported. Third-party add-on modules (like Ultimate Addons for Elementor or Divi Supreme) have varying support depending on how they store data. Most text-based custom modules work well; complex interactive modules may need manual editing.

### What happens to my styling when Respira updates a module?

Respira preserves all existing styling, settings, and structure. Only the specific content you ask to change (text, links, images) is modified. Colors, fonts, spacing, animations, and responsive settings remain intact.

### Can I undo changes made by Respira?

Yes. Respira's duplicate-first workflow means changes are made to copies, not originals. You review and approve changes in WordPress Admin (Respira → Approve Edits) before they replace the original. If you've already approved, use WordPress revisions or your backup solution.
