# Visual Composer Reference

Technical documentation for using Respira with [Visual Composer](https://visualcomposer.com/).

## About Visual Composer

[Visual Composer](https://visualcomposer.com/) is a WordPress website builder that provides a frontend editor with 500+ elements and templates. Note: Visual Composer is different from WPBakery (formerly Visual Composer Page Builder). This reference covers the newer Visual Composer Website Builder.

## Data Structure

Visual Composer stores page content as JSON in post meta. The structure consists of nested elements with unique IDs:

```json
{
  "elements": {
    "abc123": {
      "id": "abc123",
      "parent": false,
      "tag": "row",
      "order": 0
    },
    "def456": {
      "id": "def456",
      "parent": "abc123",
      "tag": "column",
      "order": 0,
      "size": { "all": "100" }
    },
    "ghi789": {
      "id": "ghi789",
      "parent": "def456",
      "tag": "basicButton",
      "order": 0,
      "title": "Get Started",
      "url": "/contact",
      "customClass": "hero-cta"
    }
  }
}
```

## Module Identification

### By Custom Class (Recommended)

Add a custom class in Element Settings:

```json
{ "admin_label": "hero-cta" }
```

### By Element ID

Each element has a unique ID:

```json
{ "admin_label": "ghi789" }
```

### By Path

```json
{ "path": "elements.ghi789" }
```

### By Type and Content

```json
{ "type": "basicButton", "match_content": "Get Started" }
```

## Common Elements

| Element | Tag | Key Attributes |
|---------|-----|----------------|
| Text Block | `textBlock` | output (HTML content) |
| Button | `basicButton` | title, url |
| Single Image | `singleImage` | image, alt |
| Heading | `heading` | text, headingTag |
| Icon | `icon` | iconPicker, link |
| Row | `row` | layout settings |
| Column | `column` | size |
| Section | `section` | layout settings |
| Hero Section | `heroSection` | background, content |
| Call to Action | `callToAction` | title, description, buttonText |

## Example Prompts for Visual Composer

**Content Updates:**

- "Update the element with class 'hero-cta' to link to /pricing"
- "Change the heading in element 'ghi789' to 'New Headline'"
- "Replace the footer address text"

**Structure Queries:**

- "Extract Visual Composer structure for page 42"
- "List all button elements on the homepage"
- "Show me all rows and their columns"

**Bulk Updates:**

- "Find all basicButton elements with 'Learn More' and change to 'Get Started'"
- "Update the phone number in all text blocks"
- "Change all H3 headings to H2"

## Hub Elements & Templates

Visual Composer Hub elements and templates are supported:

- "List all saved templates" → Shows template library
- "Update the saved 'Contact Section' template"

## Header, Footer & Sidebar Editor

Visual Composer's global areas are editable:

- "Update the header template button"
- "Change the footer copyright text to 2025"

## Limitations

- **Design options**: Margins, padding, and responsive settings may need the visual editor
- **Animations**: Element animations are preserved but need the builder to modify
- **Hub elements**: Third-party Hub elements have varying support
- **Dynamic content**: Dynamic field connections are preserved but not directly editable

## When to Use This Tool

- **Content updates** - Change text, links, and images without opening the builder
- **Template editing** - Update saved templates efficiently
- **Bulk changes** - Fix repeated content across multiple pages
- **Post-launch maintenance** - Make quick edits after client handoff
