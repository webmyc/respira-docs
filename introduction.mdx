## Get up and running in 15 minutes

Follow these five steps to install Respira for WordPress, generate an API key, set up the MCP server, and connect your AI assistant.

## 1. Install the Respira for WordPress plugin

Add the Respira for WordPress plugin to your site. This enables secure communication between WordPress and your AI assistant.

### Option A: Download from respira.press (Recommended)

1. Go to [respira.press/releases](https://respira.press/releases)
2. Download the latest `respira-for-wordpress-x.x.x.zip`
3. In WordPress Admin, go to **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**
4. Choose the ZIP file and click **Install Now**
5. Click **Activate Plugin**

### Option B: Manual installation

1. Download the plugin ZIP file
2. Extract it to your WordPress `wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Go to **Plugins** in WordPress Admin
4. Find **Respira for WordPress** and click **Activate**

## 2. Generate an API key

Your API key identifies your AI assistant when it connects to WordPress.

1. Go to **Respira → API Keys** in WordPress Admin
2. Click **Generate API Key**
3. Give it a name such as `My Development Machine`

</Callout>

## 3. Install the MCP server

The MCP server runs locally on your machine. It creates the secure bridge between your AI coding assistant and your WordPress site.

### Option A: Interactive Setup Wizard (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is using [@respira/wordpress-mcp-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@respira/wordpress-mcp-server). The wizard guides you through configuration step-by-step:

```bash
npx @respira/wordpress-mcp-server --setup
```

The setup wizard will:

- Guide you through configuration step-by-step
- Validate your WordPress URL and API key
- Test your connection before saving
- Generate the config file automatically
- Show you what to add to your AI tool

### Option B: One-Click Install for Cursor

If you're using Cursor, click the button below to install automatically:

  />
</a>

After installing, run `npx @respira/wordpress-mcp-server --setup` to create your site configuration.

### Option C: Manual npm installation

Install globally with npm:

```bash
npm install -g @respira/wordpress-mcp-server
```

Or run without installing:

```bash
npx -y @respira/wordpress-mcp-server
```

### CLI Options

```bash
npx @respira/wordpress-mcp-server --setup   # Run setup wizard
npx @respira/wordpress-mcp-server --list    # List configured sites
npx @respira/wordpress-mcp-server --test    # Test connection to default site
npx @respira/wordpress-mcp-server --help    # Show help
```

## 4. Configure your AI assistant

Connect Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, or another AI coding assistant so it can communicate with WordPress through Respira.

See the [Configuration Guide](/configuration) for detailed instructions for:

- [Cursor](/configuration#cursor)
- [Claude Code](/configuration#claude-code)
- [Windsurf](/configuration#windsurf)

You will need your site URL and the API key you created in Step 2.

## 5. Start editing with AI

Once everything is configured, you can begin editing your WordPress site using natural language instructions.

Try commands such as:

- "List all pages on my WordPress site"
- "Create a duplicate of the About page"
- "Update the homepage title to 'Welcome'"
- "Get the structure of my homepage and show me its sections"
- "Analyze the SEO of my homepage"
