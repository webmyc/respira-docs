## We're here to help

This page helps you diagnose and resolve the most common Respira for WordPress issues, including MCP server errors, API key failures, page builder detection problems, and publishing or saving issues.

## Quick Diagnostics

Before diving into specific issues, run these commands to check your setup:

```bash
# Test your connection
npx @respira/wordpress-mcp-server --test

# List configured sites
npx @respira/wordpress-mcp-server --list

# Re-run setup wizard
npx @respira/wordpress-mcp-server --setup
```

### Gathering information for support

Before requesting support, gather the following:

- Exact error messages shown in WordPress or in the MCP server console
- Output from `--test` command
- Your site URL, including protocol (https://)
- Respira for WordPress plugin version
- Whether the issue happens on a specific page, builder, or environment

## Common issues

### MCP server not connecting

**Quick fix:** Run the setup wizard again:

```bash
npx @respira/wordpress-mcp-server --setup
```

**Other checks:**

- Check that Node.js 18+ is installed: `node --version`
- Verify your config file exists at `~/.respira/config.json`
- Run `npx @respira/wordpress-mcp-server --test` to test your connection
- Review the MCP server console output for runtime errors
- Confirm your system firewall or host environment is not blocking local connections
- Restart your AI assistant (Cursor, Claude Code, etc.) after configuration changes

### API key not working

- Confirm the API key starts with `respira_` and has no extra spaces
- Check that the API key is active in WordPress Admin (Respira → API Keys)
- Ensure your site URL is correct and includes `https://`
- Review the audit log in WordPress Admin for failed API requests
- Verify the key hasn't expired or been revoked
- Try generating a new API key

### Page builder not detected

- Confirm the intended page builder plugin is installed and active
- Make sure the page or post was created with that builder
- Some page builders require specific Respira license tiers
- If detection still fails, check for JavaScript errors in the browser console
- Try reading the page directly: "Read page ID 123"

### Changes not saving

- Respira uses a duplicate-first workflow—verify you're reviewing the duplicate
- Ensure your WordPress account has permission to edit the page or post
- Review the audit log for validation or publishing errors
- Confirm that content validation is passing
- If drafts are not updating, clear any server-level or plugin caching

### Windows: 'npx' not recognized

If you see "'npx' is not recognized as an internal or external command":

- Use the full path: `C:\Program Files\nodejs\npx.cmd`
- Or install globally: `npm install -g @respira/wordpress-mcp-server`
- Ensure Node.js is in your system PATH

### Site URL mismatch

The site URL in your config must match exactly what WordPress reports:

1. In WordPress Admin, go to **Settings → General**
2. Copy the "WordPress Address (URL)" exactly
3. Update `~/.respira/config.json` with this URL
4. Re-run `npx @respira/wordpress-mcp-server --test`

## FAQ

### How do I know if the MCP server is running?

Run `npx @respira/wordpress-mcp-server --test` to check the connection. If successful, you'll see a confirmation message with your site details.

### What should I do if edits are not appearing on my site?

First check whether you are editing a duplicate page (this is expected behavior). Go to **Respira → Approve Edits** in WordPress Admin to approve changes. Also verify user permissions and clear any caching layers.

### Can I use Respira on a staging or local site?

Yes. Ensure the API key and site URL in `~/.respira/config.json` match the environment you are using. For local development, the MCP server runs on your machine alongside the AI assistant.

### How do I switch between multiple WordPress sites?

Use `wordpress_switch_site` in your AI assistant, or configure multiple sites in `~/.respira/config.json` and use `--list` to see them.

### What information should I include when contacting support?

Include your site URL, plugin version, output from `--test` command, a description of the issue, and any logs or exact error messages.
