## We're here to help

This page helps you diagnose and resolve the most common Respira for WordPress issues, including MCP server errors, API key failures, page builder detection problems, and publishing or saving issues. Use these guides to quickly identify what is going wrong and how to fix it.

### How to get help faster

Before requesting support, gather the following:

- Exact error messages shown in WordPress or in the MCP server console  
- Relevant logs (WordPress audit log, MCP server output)  
- Your site URL, including protocol (https://)  
- Respira for WordPress plugin version  
- Whether the issue happens on a specific page, builder, or environment  

Providing these details helps support diagnose issues more quickly.

## Common issues

### MCP server not connecting

- Verify the path to the MCP server is correct.  
- Check that Node.js is installed by running `node --version`.  
- Ensure the MCP server is built with `npm run build` and started correctly.  
- Review the MCP server console output for runtime errors.  
- Confirm your system firewall or host environment is not blocking local connections.

### API key not working

- Confirm the API key is entered exactly as provided with no extra spaces or line breaks.  
- Check that the API key is active inside WordPress admin.  
- Ensure your site URL is correct and includes the full protocol (`https://`).  
- Review the audit log in WordPress admin for failed API requests.  
- Verify that the key is assigned to the correct environment or domain.

### Page builder not detected

- Confirm the intended page builder plugin is installed and active.  
- Make sure the page or post you are viewing was created with that builder.  
- Some page builders require the PRO version of Respira.  
- If detection still fails, check for JavaScript errors in the browser console.

### Changes not saving

- Respira uses a duplicate-first workflow; verify whether you are editing a duplicate instead of the original page.  
- Ensure your WordPress account has permission to edit the page or post.  
- Review the audit log for validation or publishing errors.  
- Confirm that content validation is passing based on your security settings.  
- If drafts are not updating, clear any server-level or plugin caching.

## FAQ

### How do I know if the MCP server is running?

Open the terminal or command prompt where you started the server. If it is running, you should see active logs without shutdown messages. If no window is open, restart the server manually and watch for errors.

### What should I do if edits are not appearing on my site?

First check whether you are editing a duplicate page. Then verify user permissions, the audit log, and any caching layers. If the MCP server is offline, certain actions may not process correctly.

### Can I use Respira on a staging or local site?

Yes. Ensure the API key and site URL in WordPress match the environment you are using. Local development requires the MCP server to be running on your machine.

### What information should I include when contacting support?

Include your site URL, plugin version, a description of the issue, and any logs or exact error messages. This helps support reproduce and diagnose the problem quickly.
