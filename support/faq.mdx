# FAQ

## Do I need coding experience to use Respira for WordPress?

No. Respira is designed so you can work entirely through natural language. Developers can go deeper, but coding is not required.

Respira works with AI coding assistants that support the MCP protocol, including Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, and similar tools.
