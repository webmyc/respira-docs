## Using Respira for WordPress

Respira for WordPress transforms how you interact with your WordPress site by providing a secure bridge between AI coding assistants and your website. This guide covers the core workflows and best practices for maximizing productivity while maintaining site security.

## Core Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Your AI Assistant" icon="link">
    Ensure your AI assistant (Cursor, Claude Code, or Windsurf) is configured with the Respira MCP server.

    <Callout kind="tip">Run `npx @respira/wordpress-mcp-server --test` to verify your connection.</Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Explore Your Site" icon="search">
    Start by asking your AI assistant to show you what's on your site.

    Example prompts:
    - "List all pages on my WordPress site"
    - "Get the structure of my homepage"
    - "Show me the sections on the About page"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Request Changes" icon="edit">
    Describe the changes you want using natural language.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Content Updates" icon="file-text">
        "Change the headline on my About page to 'Our Story'"

        "Update the hero section text to be more conversational"
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Design Changes" icon="palette">

      </Tab>
      <Tab title="SEO Optimization" icon="search">
        "Analyze the SEO of my homepage and suggest improvements"

        "Add descriptive alt text to all images"
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Duplicates" icon="copy">
    Respira automatically creates duplicates before making changes. Review them in WordPress Admin.

    <Callout kind="info">Go to **Respira → Approve Edits** to review and approve changes before they go live.</Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Approve and Publish" icon="check-circle">
    Once satisfied with the changes, approve the duplicate to replace the original page.

    <Callout kind="alert">Always review changes before approving. This keeps your live site safe.</Callout>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Working with Page Builders

Respira supports 10 page builders. Each builder stores content differently, but Respira handles the translation automatically.

### Supported Builders

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Visual Builders" icon="layout">
    - Divi
    - Elementor
    - Bricks
    - Oxygen
    - WPBakery

    - Gutenberg (Block Editor)
    - Beaver Builder
    - Brizy
    - Visual Composer

</Columns>

### Module-Level Editing

For precise control, you can update specific modules without modifying the entire page:

```
Update the module with admin_label "Hero Section" on page ID 123.

## Multi-Site Management

If you manage multiple WordPress sites, you can switch between them:

```
Switch to the staging site
```

Or use the CLI to list configured sites:

```bash
npx @respira/wordpress-mcp-server --list
```

Configure multiple sites in `~/.respira/config.json`:

```json
{
  "sites": [
    {
      "id": "production",
      "name": "Production Site",
      "url": "https://mysite.com",
      "apiKey": "respira_prod_key",
      "default": true
    },
    {
      "id": "staging",
      "name": "Staging Site",
      "url": "https://staging.mysite.com",
      "apiKey": "respira_staging_key"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

Run the connection test:

```bash
npx @respira/wordpress-mcp-server --test
```

### Changes Not Appearing

1. Check if you're editing a duplicate (intended behavior)
2. Go to **Respira → Approve Edits** to approve changes
3. Clear any caching plugins after approval

### Page Builder Not Detected

1. Ensure the builder plugin is active
2. Verify the page was created with that builder
3. Check the audit log for detection errors
