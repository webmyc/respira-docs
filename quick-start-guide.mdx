# Quick Start Guide

This guide gets you from zero to your first safe AI-driven WordPress change as fast as possible.

## Step 1: Install the WordPress plugin

1. Download the latest plugin ZIP from `https://respira.press/releases`
2. In WordPress Admin go to **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**
3. Upload the ZIP and **Activate**

## Step 2: Generate an API key

1. In WordPress Admin go to **Respira → API Keys**
2. Click **Generate API Key**
3. Copy and save it (you won’t be able to view it again)

<Callout kind="alert">
Treat the API key like a password. If it leaks, revoke it and generate a new one.
</Callout>

## Step 3: Run the MCP setup wizard

Run the interactive setup:

```bash
npx @respira/wordpress-mcp-server --setup
```

The wizard will validate your site URL and API key, test the connection, and generate your MCP configuration.

## Step 4: Configure your AI tool

Use the configuration from the wizard, then restart your AI tool.

Common tools:

- Cursor (MCP)
- Claude Code
- Windsurf

For detailed steps, see the [Configuration Guide](/configuration).

## Step 5: Try your first commands

Start with read-only actions:

- “List all pages on my WordPress site”
- “Read page 42”
- “What page builder is my homepage using?”

Then try a safe edit (duplicate-first workflow):

- “Update the homepage headline to ‘Welcome’”

Respira will create a draft duplicate, apply the change there, and give you an approval link.

## Approve edits in WordPress

1. Go to **WordPress Admin → Respira → Approve Edits**
2. Review the duplicate draft
3. Approve to replace the original (or reject to discard)
