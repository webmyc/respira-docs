Complete Homepage Redesign Prompt
Hey, I need you to redesign my homepage using everything you know about me and my brand.

First, analyze these resources to understand who I am and what I do:
- My current website: [YOUR_CURRENT_SITE_URL]
- My portfolio/work: [YOUR_PORTFOLIO_URL]
- My LinkedIn: [YOUR_LINKEDIN_URL]
- My GitHub: [YOUR_GITHUB_URL]
- Any other relevant URLs: [ADDITIONAL_URLS]

Based on this research, design a completely new homepage for [YOUR_DOMAIN] that:

**Design Requirements:**
- Super simple business card style layout
- Looks amazing on both mobile and desktop (mobile-first)
- Modern, clean aesthetic with intentional whitespace
- Fresh color palette that matches my current brand identity
- Use relevant images and logos you find on the pages I mentioned

**Performance Requirements:**
- Loads blazing fast (target < 2s load time)
- Optimized images with proper sizing and lazy loading
- Minimal CSS and JavaScript
- Core Web Vitals compliant (LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1, INP < 200ms)

**SEO & AEO Requirements:**
- Proper heading hierarchy (single H1, logical H2-H6 structure)
- Schema markup for Person/Organization
- Semantic HTML structure for AI parsability
- Clear, scannable content with entity recognition
- FAQ section for featured snippet opportunities
- Meta description optimized for both search and AI engines

**Technical Implementation:**
Since you're connected to my site via Respira for WordPress MCP, please:
1. Create a duplicate of my current homepage first
2. Build the new layout using [DIVI/ELEMENTOR] builder
3. Include all custom CSS needed for the page
4. Make it production-ready

Output a complete implementation including:
- Full page structure with all modules

## How to Use These Prompts

1. **Analyze first:** Get the structure of the page before making changes.
2. **State your goals:** Be clear about SEO, design, accessibility, or performance objectives.
3. **Use duplicates:** Apply changes to a duplicate page for safe testing.
4. **Iterate:** Make changes in small steps and review results in the audit log.

## Best-Practice Workflow

### Step 1: Get Your Page Structure

```text
Get the structure of my homepage and show me what sections it has.
```

### Step 2: Request Improvements

```

```text
That looks good, apply those changes to a duplicate page so I can review.
```

## Comprehensive SEO Prompts

### Full SEO Audit

```text
Full SEO Audit
Run a comprehensive SEO audit on my homepage (page ID: [PAGE_ID]).

Analyze and report on:
1. Meta tags (title, description, canonical, robots)
2. Heading hierarchy (H1-H6 structure and keyword usage)
3. Content quality (word count, keyword density, readability)
4. Image optimization (alt text, file sizes, lazy loading)
5. Internal linking structure
6. Schema markup presence and validity
7. Mobile-friendliness indicators
8. Page speed factors affecting SEO

For each issue found, provide:

Then create an actionable plan to fix all issues, starting with critical ones.
