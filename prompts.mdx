## Overview

This guide provides practical WordPress AI prompts and examples for using Respira for WordPress with AI coding assistants such as Cursor or Claude. It helps you write clear, effective prompts that guide the AI when analyzing, editing, or optimizing your WordPress site.

These prompts work best when Respira is fully installed and configured. If you have not set things up yet, see the [Installation](/installation) and [Configuration](/configuration) guides.

For more background, also visit the [Introduction](/introduction), [Usage Guide](/usage), and [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting).

## How to use these prompts

1. Analyze the structure of the page before making changes.  
2. Clearly state your goals such as SEO, design, accessibility, or performance.  
3. Apply changes to a duplicate page for safe testing.  
4. Iterate in small steps and review results in the audit log.  

## Best-practice workflow for WordPress AI editing

### Step 1: Get your page structure

Ask the AI to fetch and summarize the structure of a page.

Example:  
`Get the structure of my homepage and show me what sections it has.`

### Step 2: Request improvements for a specific goal

Example:  
`Analyze this page and suggest improvements for my goal.`

Replace `my goal` with:

- **Design:** better visual hierarchy and spacing  
- **SEO:** search engine optimization  
- **Readability:** easier to read and understand  
- **Conversions:** higher conversion rates  
- **Performance:** faster loading times  
- **Accessibility:** better accessibility  
- **Mobile:** mobile responsiveness  
- **Engagement:** user engagement

### Step 3: Review and apply changes

Example:  
`That looks good, apply those changes to a duplicate page so I can review.`
