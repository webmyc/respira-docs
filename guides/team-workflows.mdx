# Team Workflows

Respira’s duplicate-first workflow makes it practical for teams to use AI safely.

## Recommended Team Pattern

## 1) Agree on naming (admin labels)

Label key modules consistently:

- HeroHeading
- HeroCTAButton
- FooterEmail
- PricingTable

Then edits become deterministic:

```text
Update the module labeled "HeroCTAButton" to say "Start Free Trial"
```

## 2) Always read before you write

Make the AI inspect the current state first:

- [wordpress_read_page](/tools/pages/read-page)
- [wordpress_extract_builder_content](/tools/builders/extract-content)

## 3) Use approvals as a team checkpoint

All edits land in drafts/duplicates first. A designated reviewer approves or rejects.

## 4) Use analysis tools in review

- [wordpress_analyze_seo](/tools/analysis/analyze-seo)
- [wordpress_analyze_performance](/tools/analysis/analyze-performance)
- [wordpress_analyze_aeo](/tools/analysis/analyze-aeo)

## 5) Track changes with consistent prompts

Have a shared “house style” prompt, including:

- What to change
- What must not change
- How to report changes (diff summary)
- Which tools to use (module-level vs full-page edits)
