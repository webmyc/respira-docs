# Multi-Site Management

Respira supports multiple WordPress sites in a single MCP server configuration. This is ideal for agencies and teams with staging/production environments.

## Typical Setup

You might have:

- Production site
- Staging site
- A client site

## Switching Sites

Use [wordpress_switch_site](/tools/other/switch-site) to change the active site:

```text
Switch to siteId "staging"
```

Then run the rest of your tools normally (they’ll apply to the selected site).

## Best Practices

- Keep staging as your default site when doing risky edits
- Run analysis tools (SEO/performance) on production first, but apply fixes on staging
- Promote changes after approval/review

## Useful Tool Pairs

- Site overview: [wordpress_get_site_context](/tools/context/get-site-context)
- Content inventory: [wordpress_list_pages](/tools/pages/list-pages), [wordpress_list_posts](/tools/posts/list-posts)
- Safe updates: [wordpress_update_page](/tools/pages/update-page), [wordpress_update_post](/tools/posts/update-post)
